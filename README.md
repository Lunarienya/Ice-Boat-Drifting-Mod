# Ice Boat Drifting Mod
There is now a decreased air resistance when speeding off of an ice track.
Specifically, velocity is multiplied by 0.99 every call to updateVelocity in the air.
I may add support to vary this value in the future.

Step height for boats is now 1, which means you can climb ramps of ice.

I was inspired to create this to make ice boat highways.
